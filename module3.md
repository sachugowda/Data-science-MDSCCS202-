# Module 3: Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Overview

In this module, we will explore data visualization using two of the most widely-used libraries in Python: Matplotlib and Seaborn. These libraries allow you to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, making them essential tools for data analysis and presentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Understand the basics of data visualization and its importance in data analysis.
2. Create and customize simple and complex plots using Matplotlib.
3. Use Seaborn for advanced statistical plots and data visualization.
4. Integrate visualizations into your data analysis workflow.

## Topics Covered

### Topic 1: Simple Line Graph

In this topic, we will start with the basics of creating simple line graphs using Matplotlib. Line graphs are useful for visualizing trends over time or continuous data.
